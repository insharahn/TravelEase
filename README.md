## Traveler
for u guys, here's what ive done so far

# sign up form
- enter all info AND inserts in table so be careful
- age is now DOB
- validation checks for email format, password length, username uniqueness, contact number all digits [all of our ddl commands]
- preferences are concatenated and inserted comma seperated
- location is inserted like city (country) based on existing location ids -> i do plan on adding more
- in the nationality dropdown, typing the city actually brings that result to the top
- really ugly formatting im sorry guys i cant make the form any longer its not letting me and i have no space
